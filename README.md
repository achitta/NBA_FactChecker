# NBA_Twilio_Bot

Welcome to NBA Twilio Bot. This is a web application that sends users real-time NBA score updates as a text message and allows users to query NBA players' season and career statistics and immediately recieve responses as an SMS. Additionally, I developed a separate GUI using PyQt5 tools to allow users to query a wider range of information and subscribe to the texting service.
